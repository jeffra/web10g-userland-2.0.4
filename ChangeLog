web10g-userland-2.0.4:

	Fixed reporting of IPv6 addresses in tcpe_list_conns.

	Added tcpe_write_var function and example client (writevar).
	N.B. currently writevar is only implemented for two of the four
	writable variables defined in RFC 4898, LimCwnd and LimRwin.
	This is an initial implementation, and deserves further testing,
	but has been included in this release for consideration.

	Added function tcpe_data_delta for taking difference of counters,
	and client deltavars.

There are 3 steps to installation of Web10G userland:

(1) Install the Web10G kernel patch.

	The Web10G kernel patch is available from the project web site,
	http://web10g.org. For the current Alpha versions, there is a
	tight correlation between the kernel patch and userland releases;
	for the current release, the patch is included in the userland
	distribution.

	The kernel patches are against a mainline kernel, available
	from kernel.org, of micro version 0; for example, the current
	release is against version 3.5.0. Patching against later micro
	versions will often work, with reasonable offset, to produce a
	viable kernel, but this is not tested.

	One should have a reproducible manner of building and installing
	a mainline kernel, irrespective of the Web10G patch.

	The pertinent configure options are:
		Networking support --->
		  Networking options --->
		    [*] TCP: Extended TCP statistics (TCP ESTATS) MIB

	This will enable the loadable kernel module:
		Networking support --->
		  Networking options --->
		    [*] TCP: Extended TCP statistics (TCP ESTATS) MIB
		    <M>   TCP: ESTATS netlink module

	Previous versions encouraged setting the default congestion control
	to RENO:

		Networking support --->
		  Networking options --->
		    [*] TCP: advanced congestion control --->
		        Default TCP congestion control (Reno)

	However accommodations for CUBIC, BIC, and H-TCP are now implemented.

	The loadable kernel module produced is named "tcp_estats_nl".


(2) Install libmnl.

	The current release uses libmnl for genetlink support; a distribution
	is included.

	libmnl is a "minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink
	developers" (http://www.netfilter.org/projects/libmnl/index.html).

	Web10G hides the netlink client library with opaque types, so changes
	in this choice will not affect the API.

	N.B.:

	If one prefers to install libmnl via a Linux distribution package
	manager, one should also install the (commonly-named) libmnl-devel
	package for the header files.

	If one installs from source, the default prefix will be /usr/local;
	one then needs to add the appropriate pkgconfig path to one's
	environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH, say,

	export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/

	as the configure script uses the macro PKG_CHECK_MODULES.

	This is a general issue with pkg-config, as is the need, for many
	Linux distributions, of adding /usr/local/{lib,lib64} to ld.so.conf
	or ld.so.conf.d/ and running ldconfig.

	The above two requirements are well-known issues for installation
	of software in Linux, and by no means specific to either libmnl
	or Web10G.

(3) Install Web10G.

	./configure
	make
	sudo make install


To run the examples, first load the module:

	sudo modprobe tcp_estats_nl

Then try the following tools; firstly run

	listconns

to list all connections in the form:

CID LocalAddress LocalPort RemoteAddress RemotePort

For a given CID of interest, one can run

	readvars CID

for an atomic read of all MIB variables, or

	watchvars CID     or     deltavars CID

for a repeated read of counters or difference of counters, each second.
For details on querying the kernel for a subset of variables, run, e.g.,

	deltavars -h
